            I'm a <span className="text-green-700">Full-Stack Developer</span>{" "}
            with a strong passion for backend development, API design, and
            building scalable, efficient systems.
            <br />
            <br /> I enjoy solving real-world problems through clean,
            maintainable code and robust, logical architecture. My core strength
            lies in backend systems, working extensively with Node.js, Express,
            and MongoDB. At the same time, I leverage modern UI libraries to
            deliver smooth and responsive frontend experiences. <br />
            <br />
            I'm always exploring ways to optimize performance, integrate tools,
            and create reliable, maintainable system architectures. I thrive on
            contributing to meaningful projectsâ€”especially those that push me to
            learn, collaborate, and make a lasting impact.
